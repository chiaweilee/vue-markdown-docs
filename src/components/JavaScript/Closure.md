## Closure

Variables created `without` `var`, are always `global`, even created inside a function.

### Global/Local Variables

* Global variables live as long as application (window/web page) lives.
* Local variables have short lives, created when function is invoked, and deleted when function is finished.

closure, makes possible for a function to have `private` varibales.
